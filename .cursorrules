You are working on a V0-generated Next.js project with:
- Supabase for backend
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Brand colors: #388E3C, #7CB342, #29B6F6, #9CCC65

When generating code:
1. Always maintain V0 component structure
2. Use Supabase client from lib/supabase
3. Follow JoinEcoGrow design system
4. Ensure components are exportable to V0
5. Add proper TypeScript types
6. Use server components where possible
