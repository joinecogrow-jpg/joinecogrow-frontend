# Quick Access to Your JoinEcoGrow Platform

## 🚀 **Working URLs:**

### Primary (Latest with V0-Cursor Integration):
**https://joinecogrow-platform-av9u7ndir-joinecogrow-9640s-projects.vercel.app**

### Alternative:
**https://joinecogrow-platform-rberegvyw-joinecogrow-9640s-projects.vercel.app**

## 🔧 **Domain Issue:**
- `joinecogrow.com` is configured in Vercel ✅
- But nameservers point to Cloudflare instead of Vercel ❌
- This causes the 404 error

## 📋 **To Fix joinecogrow.com:**

### Option A: Change Nameservers (Easiest)
1. Go to your domain registrar
2. Change nameservers to:
   - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
   - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
3. Wait 24-48 hours

### Option B: Configure Cloudflare DNS
1. Log into Cloudflare dashboard
2. Add A record: `@` → `76.76.19.61`
3. Add CNAME: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. Wait 5-10 minutes

### Option C: Keep Using Vercel URL
Your platform is fully functional on the Vercel URL above!

## 🎯 **Current Status:**
- ✅ Platform is deployed and working
- ✅ V0-Cursor integration is active
- ✅ All features are functional
- ❌ Custom domain needs DNS configuration
